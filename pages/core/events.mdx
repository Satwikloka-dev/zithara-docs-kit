# Events

Events are the **source of truth** in Zithara.

Everything that happens generates an event.

---

## What Is an Event?

An event represents:
- A call made
- A message sent
- A review received
- A task completed
- A customer action

---

## Why Events Matter

Events enable:
- Real-time automation
- Accurate analytics
- Reliable audits
- AI-driven insights

---

## Event-Driven Architecture

Instead of polling or manual updates:
- Events trigger rules
- Rules trigger actions

This creates a responsive system.

---

## Events Power the Framework

Without events:
- Automation breaks
- AI lacks context
- Insights become delayed

Events make Zithara intelligent by default.
