# Locations

Retail happens at locations, not just brands.

Zithara treats locations as first-class primitives.

## Store-Level Context

Each location has:
- Its own customers
- Its own staff
- Its own performance metrics
- Its own automation settings

## Centralized Control, Local Execution

Brands can:
- Define global rules
- Customize local behavior

This enables scalable growth without losing local nuance.
