# RFM Segmentation

RFM stands for **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value**.

Zithara uses RFM as a **behavioral scoring system**, not just a classification.

---

## Why RFM Works for Retail

RFM answers three critical questions:
- How recently did the customer engage?
- How often do they engage?
- How valuable is their engagement?

Together, these define customer intent and loyalty.

## Zithara’s RFM Model

Zithara calculates RFM scores using:
- Purchase events
- Engagement events
- Store interactions
- Channel activity

Scores update automatically as new events occur.

## RFM Segments Examples

- Champions
- Loyal Customers
- Potential Loyalists
- At-Risk Customers
- Dormant Customers

These segments are **not static labels**.

They shift dynamically as behavior changes.

## Operational Use of RFM

RFM segments can:
- Trigger win-back campaigns
- Adjust agent priorities
- Influence discount strategies
- Guide AI recommendations

RFM is a decision engine, not a dashboard.
