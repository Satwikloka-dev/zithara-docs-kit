# Dynamic Segments

Dynamic segments are **rule-based cohorts** that update in real time.

They allow teams to define *who matters right now*.

## How Dynamic Segments Work

A dynamic segment is defined by:
- Events
- Attributes
- Time windows
- Behavioral thresholds

Customers enter and exit automatically.

---

## Example Dynamic Segments

- Customers who called but did not convert in 48 hours
- High-value customers inactive for 30 days
- New customers with multiple conversations
- Customers who left a negative review recently

---

## Event-Driven Membership

Segment membership changes when:
- A call happens
- A message is sent
- A task is completed
- A review is received

No manual refresh required.

## Why Dynamic Segments Matter

They enable:
- Real-time automation
- Precise targeting
- Reduced noise
- Faster responses

Dynamic segments turn data into action.
