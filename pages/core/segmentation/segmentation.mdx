# Segmentation Framework

Segmentation in Zithara is **not a static filter**.

It is a **living system** that continuously evolves as customer behavior changes.

## Why Segmentation Matters in Retail

Retail customers are:
- Non-linear
- Multi-channel
- Emotion-driven
- Event-driven

Static segments fail to capture this reality.

Zithara introduces **behavior-first segmentation**.

## Segmentation as a Primitive

Segments in Zithara:
- Are event-driven
- Update in real time
- Power automation, AI, and campaigns

They are not reports — they are **operational inputs**.

---

## Types of Segmentation

- **RFM Segmentation** — value-based customer grouping
- **Dynamic Segments** — rule-based, real-time cohorts

Both are deeply integrated into the core framework.

---

## Where Segments Are Used

Segments can:
- Trigger automation rules
- Control campaign targeting
- Personalize conversations
- Influence AI decision-making

Segmentation is not downstream — it is foundational.
