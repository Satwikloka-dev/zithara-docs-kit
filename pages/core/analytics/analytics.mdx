# Analytics Framework

Analytics in Zithara are **event-native**, not report-first.

Instead of asking “What happened last month?”  
Zithara answers “What should happen next?”

---

## Analytics Built on Events

Every insight in Zithara is derived from:
- Conversations
- Calls
- Tasks
- Reviews
- Customer actions

There is no duplicated or delayed data.

---

## Analytics as a Control Layer

Analytics in Zithara:
- Feed automation
- Influence segmentation
- Guide AI decisions

They are not passive dashboards.

---

## Core Analytics Areas

- **NPS Management**
- **Operational Insights**
- **Customer Health Signals**

Each is tightly coupled with the core framework.

---

## Designed for Action

If an insight cannot trigger an action,  
it does not belong in Zithara analytics.
