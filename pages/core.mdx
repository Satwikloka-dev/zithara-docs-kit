# Core Primitives

Zithara is built on a small set of **core primitives**.

These are not features or modules — they are **foundational building blocks** that define how retail systems should work.

Every workflow, automation rule, and AI action in Zithara is powered by these primitives.

## Why Core Primitives Matter

Traditional CRMs add features endlessly:
- Leads
- Deals
- Pipelines
- Reports

Zithara instead defines **primitives** that can be composed into any retail workflow.

This makes the platform:
- Flexible
- Extensible
- Future-proof

## The Core Primitives

- **Customers**
- **Leads**
- **Conversations**
- **Tasks**
- **Events**
- **Locations**
- **Users & Teams**

Together, these form the operational backbone of Zithara.

## Designed for Retail Scale

Each primitive is:
- Channel-agnostic
- Store-aware
- Event-driven
- Automation-ready

This is what enables Zithara to function as a framework.
