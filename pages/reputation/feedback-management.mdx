# Feedback Management

Not all feedback is public — but all feedback is valuable.

Zithara captures, organizes, and operationalizes **private customer feedback**.

## Sources of Feedback

Zithara collects feedback from:
- Post-purchase surveys
- WhatsApp interactions
- Email responses
- Voice calls
- In-store follow-ups

All feedback becomes structured data.

---

## Sentiment & Context Awareness

Feedback is analyzed for:
- Sentiment
- Urgency
- Topic classification
- Customer history

This allows smarter prioritization.

---

## Feedback-Driven Workflows

Feedback can automatically:
- Create tasks
- Notify managers
- Trigger recovery campaigns
- Update customer health scores

Issues are addressed before they go public.

## Closing the Loop

Zithara ensures:
- Customers are acknowledged
- Actions are tracked
- Outcomes are measured

Feedback becomes a growth mechanism, not a liability.
