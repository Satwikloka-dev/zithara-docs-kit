# Event-Driven Data Model

Zithara is built on **events**, not static records.

This enables real-time automation and accurate insights.

---

## Why Events Matter

Traditional CRMs store snapshots:
- A lead
- A task
- A status

Retail requires understanding **what happened and when**.

---

## Events as First-Class Citizens

In Zithara:
- Calls generate events
- Messages generate events
- Reviews generate events
- Store visits generate events

Everything is time-aware and actionable.

---

## Unified Customer Context

Events across channels are linked to:
- Customers
- Stores
- Campaigns
- Conversations

This creates a complete, evolving customer profile.

---

## Built for Scale and Replay

An event-driven model allows:
- Reliable automation
- Debugging and audits
- Future AI analysis
- Scalable growth

This is what makes Zithara a framework, not just a tool.
