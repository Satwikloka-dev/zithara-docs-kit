# Automation-First Framework

Automation in Zithara is not a feature.  
It is a **design principle**.

---

## The Cost of Manual Retail Operations

Manual follow-ups lead to:
- Missed opportunities
- Inconsistent customer experience
- Burnout for store teams

Retail scale requires automation.

---

## Automation as a Primitive

In Zithara:
- Events trigger actions
- Rules define behavior
- Workflows replace manual effort

Automation is embedded at the foundation.

---

## Examples of Automation

- Missed calls trigger callbacks
- New leads create tasks
- Reviews trigger follow-ups
- Inactive customers trigger campaigns

---

## Human Control, Machine Speed

Automation assists teams — it doesn’t replace them.

Zithara ensures that automation:
- Is transparent
- Is configurable
- Can be overridden when needed
