# Omnichannel as a Core Principle

Customers don’t think in channels.  
They think in conversations.

Zithara treats all communication channels as part of a **single customer journey**.

## The Problem with Channel Silos

Most tools separate:
- WhatsApp conversations
- Phone calls
- Social messages
- Emails

This breaks context and continuity.

---

## Zithara’s Omnichannel Model

Zithara unifies:
- Voice calls
- WhatsApp messages
- Social DMs
- Emails and SMS

into a **single conversation timeline**.

---

## Why This Matters

- Teams respond faster
- Customers repeat themselves less
- Automation becomes possible
- Attribution becomes accurate

Omnichannel is not an add-on — it’s foundational.

## Channel-Agnostic Automation

Because all channels are unified, automation works consistently regardless of how a customer interacts.
